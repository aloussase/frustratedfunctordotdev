    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm Alexander Goussas. I'm currently working as a software developer at Thoughtworks.
        Prior to this, I worked in national industry here in Ecuador at Tia S.A. and ESPOL.
        The last one is also the university where I studied Computer Science, but I abandoned my
        degree in the last semester for <em>reasons</em>. The project I was working on was a custom OTEL collector
        to attempt to reduce the performance impact of distributed tracing.
    </p>

        I was born here in Ecuador, but spent most of my childhood in Venezuela and Spain. Fun fact: I was in Spain when
        they won their first World Cup. In my free time, I love reading, learning (human) languages and working on side
        projects. My favourite literature genre is fantasy (I have Mistborn tattoos), but I also read philosophy and
        others.
    </p>

        This blog serves as a way to share the stuff I learn and that I think might be useful to others.
        If you have any comments or questions about any material on this site, feel free to send me an email.
