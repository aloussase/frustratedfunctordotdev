    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm Alexander Goussas. I'm currently working as a software developer at Thoughtworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in Ecuador, but spent most of my childhood in Venezuela and Spain. In my free time, I love
        reading, learning (human) languages and working on side projects. I also play the bass, and I'm learning to
        play the guitar and piano and taking singing classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This blog serves as a way to share the stuff I learn and that I think might be useful to others.
        I might also throw in a rant from time to time.
        If you have any comments or questions about any material on this site, feel free to send me an email.
